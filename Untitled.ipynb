Casado succeeds previous leader and former Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, who resigned in June after losing a no-confidence vote in the Spanish Parliament. Pedro Sánchez, leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party took up the position of Prime Minister the day after Rajoy's resignation. Casado beat the former vice-prime minister Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría in the electoral contest. He is considered to be the more conservative of the two candidates and his victory signals a move further to the right for the PP.  The PP has been plagued with corruption allegations for years. Rajoy faced the humiliation of testifying in cases against members of his party, though he was not among the accused. The confidence motion was filed by Sanchez after a court convicted Rajoy's former aides of running slush funds to help finance Popular Party election campaigns. The court also questioned the credibility of Rajoy's testimony during the proceedings.\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180721082902-01-pablo-casado-blanco-0721-story-body.jpg', 'language': 'en', 'tags': [{'id': 'f0718927-a422-4a3c-93ef-b26ee60eebd1'}, {'id': '3b05b667-bbc2-4ea2-9b4b-bfec81011a99'}, {'id': '6b05b474-af4a-4829-89b5-e19952888c64'}, {'id': '8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e'}, {'id': '85186acd-6f35-432b-9fd7-5586c122151d'}, {'id': '9bcd9f98-0314-43c5-b4a6-4c06a3180d4d'}, {'id': '15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158'}, {'id': '8d12fa13-0159-4c46-ad62-5fb4958343b3'}, {'id': 'b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c'}, {'id': '569432e3-cee0-4fdd-9009-e2be2a42ab54'}, {'id': 'fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9'}, {'id': '9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab'}, {'id': '9b9aed9f-e3a5-479a-81e5-600f0b0cb607'}]}, {'_id': 'h_e9fef9fb12709021222bfa9519d0bd45', 'type': 'article', 'sourceId': 'article_4F64BD88-56D5-B52E-6048-B55DA203A6DE', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/europe/carles-puigdemont-arrest-warrant-dropped-intl/index.html', 'path': '/2018/07/19/europe/carles-puigdemont-arrest-warrant-dropped-intl', 'source': 'cnn', 'location': None, 'byLine': 'By Euan McKirdy, Richard Greene and Vasco Cotovio, CNN', 'contributors': ['Euan McKirdy', 'Richard Allen Greene', 'Vasco Cotovio'], 'firstPublishDate': '2018-07-20T02:44:48Z', 'lastModifiedDate': '2018-07-20T02:44:45Z', 'headline': 'Exiled Catalan leader has Europe-wide arrest warrant dropped', 'section': 'europe', 'mappedSection': 'WORLD', 'body': 'Spanish prosecutors have dropped a European Arrest Warrant for former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, over his part in last October\\'s controversial independence referendum. Five other separatists wanted by Madrid, also had their Europe-wide warrants dropped, effectively meaning they are free to move around the EU. Spanish arrest warrants for the six still stand, so they can be arrested if they return to the country, the country\\'s prosecutors said in a statement Thursday. Spain wants to try the separatist leader for rebellion in light of his push for Catalan independence, but a German court refused last week to extradite him on that charge. The German court did say he could be extradited to face a corruption charge.  Puigdemont has been living in Germany since May, when he was initially detained after crossing into the country from Denmark. The former Catalan leader says that dropping the Europe-wide warrant was \"proof of the immense weakness\" of the case against him and the other Catalan separatists, he wrote in a tweet on Thursday.  He also repeated his call for Spanish authorities to release the members of his government who remain in jail. \"Today is a day to demand, with more strength than ever, the freedom of the political prisoners,\" he said in the tweet. \"To revoke their arrest on remand would be the demonstration that Spanish judiciary is beginning to act like the European.\" Puidgemont\\'s lawyers in Germany called the decision \"reasonable\" and a consequence of their efforts over the past weeks, they said in a statement to CNN on Thursday. \"Spain\\'s European-wide persecution of Carles Puigdemont has therefore ended,\" the lawyers said. \"As we have said since the beginning of the procedure: political conflicts of a state must be carried out politically, not by the means of criminal law.\" 125-mile-long human chain calls for Basque independence vote Detained crossing the border Protests broke out in Barcelona earlier in the year after news that the separatist had been detained in Germany while en route to Belgium from Finland. He was detained after crossing the border from Denmark. Prior to his detention, he had lived in self-imposed exile in Belgium since October, after spearheading Catalonia\\'s referendum on whether to secede from Spain. The independence drive plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, with Madrid denouncing the referendum as illegal and calling for Puigdemont\\'s arrest. Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia after the regional parliament unilaterally declared independence in October, thereby stripping the autonomous region of many of its administrative powers. The situation remains unresolved.  The political calculus in Spain shifted significantly following the election of Catalan separatist President Quim Torra in May and socialist Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, in June, following a no-confidence vote that ousted the right-wing government of Mariano Rajoy.

The high court in Schleswig-Holstein, the state where Puigdemont was first arrested in March, ruled Thursday that extradition on the grounds of alleged misappropriation of public funds is admissible. Puigdemont and several other former Catalan leaders have been accused by Spanish authorities of misusing funds by holding the independence referendum last October, which Madrid described as illegal. The court also ruled, however, that the deposed leader\\'s actions in Catalonia do not meet the definitions of high treason or breach of the peace and the violence triggered by the bid for independence did not pose a severe threat to Spanish rule.  He therefore cannot be extradited on a \"rebellion\" charge and, if he is returned to Spain, Spanish authorities cannot prosecute Puigdemont based on that accusation. In a statement, Puigdemont\\'s legal team welcomed the court\\'s rejection of the \"rebellion\" charge and attacked the Spanish authorities for the threat of prosecution. \"Carles Puigdemont is being prosecuted by the Spanish judiciary only because he allowed a democratic referendum to go ahead, which his voters had mandated him to do.\" They added that Germany should not take part \"in such a criminalization of democratic behavior\" and should stay out of \"Spanish quarrels.\"  The Catalan leader fled to Belgium in October after spearheading Catalonia\\'s independence referendum. Spain was plunged into its worst political crisis in decades as the vote divided the country and was declared illegal by then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who called for Puigdemont\\'s arrest. Madrid later imposed direct rule on Catalonia, stripping the autonomous region of many of its administrative powers. While en route from Finland to Belgium in late March, Puigdemont was detained in northern Germany, where courts began proceedings to assess the case for extradition. According to Thursday\\'s ruling, he has been complying with the authorities and is not currently in custody.', 'thumbnail': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180325090933-01-carles-puigdemont-0325-story-body.jpg', 'language': 'en', 'tags': [{'id': 'fd529c2d-a4f7-4f7e-b39a-850e8a28c03f'}, {'id': 'fbe98f94-1270-4f73-beb1-6afa11d63269'}, {'id': '3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734'}, {'id': 'd2cb73e8-f654-45e1-90f4-af9fccb7d4d5'}, {'id': '99e7db47-1f0c-40b1-9b6b-55a67c93eb7a'}, {'id': '7cf1f440-e495-485b-a420-e92a3908f851'}, {'id': '38786898-a388-4710-9e25-4087e4f0b57d'}, {'id': '590008e8-b76f-434c-9cba-52a1e39e1568'}, {'id': '8d7177ef-0a7e-44b5-9a58-6c98c0968023'}, {'id': '86f1d6f8-6a48-4e2c-8c1c-d3a9cbc794c2'}, {'id': 'a7533e1a-8a54-48b5-aab0-065e872e3fa2'}, {'id': '6325d5d1-09d4-48ba-a021-b3578a717ba8'}, {'id': 'ea3bc350-6ddf-4321-b5d6-aa8b85b8ee90'}, {'id': '6b05b474-af4a-4829-89b5-e19952888c64'}, {'id': '15e45799-61c9-5d8b-80a1-86d63bc464cb'}, {'id': '1284a3f6-c163-4839-a42a-3663595a0caf'}, {'id': '58da1feb-6773-40a4-bb2c-2267f06c5689'}, {'id': '6be6f4e4-c3db-5be9-9446-85a03eebed3c'}, {'id': '3814b33d-7fc9-4125-ab3f-fc155effac19'}, {'id': '8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e'}, {'id': 'c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d'}, {'id': 'bfbad1a7-137f-47f7-9126-daaaf3f3984c'}, {'id': '367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6'}, {'id': 'b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1'}, {'id': '7691bc4e-7b66-4400-9ce9-789f697ada59'}, {'id': '85186acd-6f35-432b-9fd7-5586c122151d'}, {'id': '9bcd9f98-0314-43c5-b4a6-4c06a3180d4d'}, {'id': '15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158'}, {'id': '8d12fa13-0159-4c46-ad62-5fb4958343b3'}, {'id': 'b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c'}, {'id': 'b8f769d9-5380-41b9-9732-fb82bd97bbb2'}, {'id': '569432e3-cee0-4fdd-9009-e2be2a42ab54'}, {'id': 'cd86b20b-6403-4e78-b813-1bb72ae1e550'}, {'id': 'fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9'}, {'id': '303242a9-fb4b-5a07-85d4-ecad83b10edc'}, {'id': '5da77f4f-b1c0-4f34-85db-e9e8ec049abe'}, {'id': '9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab'}, {'id': '371d0edb-606f-5060-9394-aa93235b9684'}, {'id': '38f576f7-4089-5f1f-be42-e43fb2a10b94'}, {'id': '84651cf3-02b9-4e37-8627-dc8b96235ba7'}, {'id': '12967d01-3194-4c24-b4a8-91f471860718'}]}, {'_id': 'h_27bec74556be6afc532c886b6ee8989c', 'type': 'article', 'sourceId': 'article_2F4AECE3-A4AF-7C01-B8CD-1498B71E92DF', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/13/opinions/europe-is-facing-a-crisis-of-confidence-robertson-opinion/index.html', 'path': '/2017/10/13/opinions/europe-is-facing-a-crisis-of-confidence-robertson-opinion', 'source': 'cnn', 'location': None, 'byLine': 'By Nic Robertson, CNN', 'contributors': ['Nic Robertson'], 'firstPublishDate': '2017-10-13T10:58:03Z', 'lastModifiedDate': '2018-06-11T15:12:28Z', 'headline': \"Europe's crisis of confidence is starting to have consequences\", 'section': 'opinions', 'mappedSection': 'OPINION', 'body': 'A lot has been happening in Europe this week. Much of it has tested the European Union\\'s ability to handle a crisis, though little has reflected well on Brussels. As Catalonia\\'s president was trying to side step a self-inflicted confrontation with the Spanish government, Brussels was busy fumbling the Brexit ball. Carles Puigdemont\\'s referendum -- declared illegal by Spanish courts -- has propelled him and his nation\\'s separatists into a showdown with Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish Prime Minister, just as the British and EU Brexit negotiators were arriving at their own impasse on Britain\\'s divorce bill.  A preoccupation with their own woes over Brexit perhaps explains why senior EU officials appeared tone deaf to Spain\\'s separatists -- who, it should be remembered, are EU citizens.  Indeed, major issues have been clogging up the EU\\'s inbox lately, each one competing for the attention of Europe\\'s top guns. President Donald Trump appears on the verge of unraveling one of Europe\\'s smugger foreign policy successes: the nuclear deal with Iran, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Smug, because while America led the actual deal-making, it was European companies who were among the first to race in to Tehran and cut big business deals. If Trump does throw a wrench into the Iran deal, it is EU nations that will feel the pinch first. Then there is the Ukraine crisis and European relations with Russia. The EU has looked flat-footed for some time now on coming up with any kind of plan to stop the rot. Perhaps, however, the weightiest and most distracting item in the inbox exposes some of Europe\\'s deepest fault lines: competing French and German visions of a more integrated Europe and the very future of the continent. More is being expected of the EU now than in recent years and when put to the challenge, walking whilst talking has thus far not come easily. The EU\\'s stumbles seemed most stark in the week leading up to Puigdemont\\'s halfway announcement of independence.  On October 1, Spanish police injured more than 800 Catalan voters while they tried to cast their ballot in the independence referendum. In the following days, senior EU officials appeared to condone Spanish police brutality against the Catalans in the unconstitutional referendum. Frans Timmermans, the EU Commission\\'s vice president, went as far as saying that the police had a right to use \"proportionate force.\"  Timmerman\\'s tepid response is typical of what many EU critics have come to expect from a bureaucracy that often appears more in touch with its own aspirations than those of the citizens it represents.   The following week, Britain\\'s Brexit negotiators arrived in Brussels for another entanglement with their EU counterparts. Trenches are being dug and positions are beginning to freeze. Both French and German leaders have worsened the chill, seemingly throwing cold water on the EU\\'s top negotiator Michel Barnier\\'s initiative to talk future trade before the UK comes clean on what it will pay to settle its exit bill. Back in Barcelona, Catalans were weighing the cost and meaning of their own apparent exit bill, paid in blood, to exercise what they see elsewhere in Europe, like Scotland, as a democratic right to vote for independence. Instinctively, they looked to the EU to support them. They might as well have called the man in the moon. Already preoccupied by Brexit, Iran, Ukraine and its own future, the EU managed the equivalent of raising its collective head, flicking its eyes in Madrid\\'s direction, announcing the referendum and the violence a Spanish constitutional issue, and slumping back to Brexit talks.  For those who thought the EU a mightier and more omnipresent entity, this may all come as something of a shock.  Yet Catalan President Puigdemont, who feels he\\'s answered European Council President Donald Tusk\\'s call to avoid an escalation by seeking talks rather than immediately declaring independence, believes the EU is obliged to help him deliver the independence for which his people voted. Perhaps Puigdemont is unfortunate that just when he needs the EU to help keep alive Catalan dreams of independence, the EU is fighting its own separatist tide. Yet whether the EU realizes it or not, Puigdemont\\'s pleas for it to mediate between him and Madrid are exposing either a lack of understanding of the gravity of the situation or an inability to deal with it. Both are a damning indictment of a supranational entity like the EU. Puigdemont\\'s speech in the Catalan Parliament Tuesday indicates he has rolled the dice, arguably a little late, that policy -- not police -- is the path to separation. Rajoy\\'s answer from Madrid points to the reverse being on his mind, which makes EU mediation to manage the separatist genie all the more urgent. In the hours ahead of Puigdemont\\'s speech, Rajoy\\'s government deployed state police to Barcelona\\'s High Court. They stood side by side with Catalonia\\'s local police, the Mossos, who are the building\\'s regular guards. But Madrid\\'s message was clear: if we don\\'t like what we hear, the two police forces may face off. At a time when supranational institutions like the EU, the UN and NATO are coming under increasing pressure and having their validity called into question, the EU has an opportunity to stand tall and demonstrate the stability it was created to provide. Lines are being drawn and this is no time for the EU to look away and mumble about Brexit or Iran. It\\'s time for Brussels to grasp that opportunity and shore up Europe\\'s self-confidence -- before that starts crumbling too.', 'thumbnail': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171005190434-manfred-weber-amanpour-story-body.jpg', 'language': 'en', 'tags': [{'id': 'fbe98f94-1270-4f73-beb1-6afa11d63269'}, {'id': 'f8123605-1a64-411e-8b4f-4ad497e143c0'}, {'id': '009acee4-85c0-4459-8804-09b4bcc362df'}, {'id': '99e7db47-1f0c-40b1-9b6b-55a67c93eb7a'}, {'id': '7cf1f440-e495-485b-a420-e92a3908f851'}, {'id': '38786898-a388-4710-9e25-4087e4f0b57d'}, {'id': '15e45799-61c9-5d8b-80a1-86d63bc464cb'}, {'id': '8d12fa13-0159-4c46-ad62-5fb4958343b3'}, {'id': '80472d18-063b-58fb-85a5-f716fdb8b777'}, {'id': '3814b33d-7fc9-4125-ab3f-fc155effac19'}, {'id': '6b05b474-af4a-4829-89b5-e19952888c64'}, {'id': '83b82b76-7940-4a1d-992a-7da5ea85f539'}, {'id': '8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e'}, {'id': 'c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d'}, {'id': '3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734'}, {'id': '49b3767f-e5b3-40be-aee2-f6c1d7c9fe7c'}, {'id': 'a82dffe9-937e-42c0-9c66-db3f2f4fcca8'}, {'id': '85186acd-6f35-432b-9fd7-5586c122151d'}, {'id': '9bcd9f98-0314-43c5-b4a6-4c06a3180d4d'}, {'id': '15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158'}, {'id': '4cc639d4-137b-48b6-91b2-4187cf9968d1'}, {'id': 'b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c'}, {'id': 'b8f769d9-5380-41b9-9732-fb82bd97bbb2'}, {'id': '3ba05602-a998-433e-bb78-dfa711c52ab1'}, {'id': '569432e3-cee0-4fdd-9009-e2be2a42ab54'}, {'id': 'cd86b20b-6403-4e78-b813-1bb72ae1e550'}, {'id': 'fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9'}, {'id': '38f576f7-4089-5f1f-be42-e43fb2a10b94'}, {'id': 'bd7ac37a-ac39-4178-99cf-d642e85ef5ca'}]}, {'_id': 'h_9d499554a7108cb716f6369e3674a501', 'type': 'article', 'sourceId': 'article_96EA1E7E-B055-AEFA-7EE8-EE62B6252F77', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/11/europe/human-chain-basque-country-independence-vote-intl/index.html', 'path': '/2018/06/11/europe/human-chain-basque-country-independence-vote-intl', 'source': 'cnn', 'location': None, 'byLine': 'By Rory Smith, CNN', 'contributors': ['Rory Smith'], 'firstPublishDate': '2018-06-11T14:27:19Z', 'lastModifiedDate': '2018-06-11T14:10:32Z', 'headline': '125-mile-long human chain calls for Basque independence vote', 'section': 'europe', 'mappedSection': 'WORLD', 'body': 'Almost 200,000 people joined together Sunday in Spain\\'s Basque Country to create a 202-kilometer (125-mile) human chain to make the case for having a vote on independence. The chain was organized by the Basque group Gure Esku Dago (In Our Own Hands), and stretched from the seaside resort of San Sebastián west to the city of Bilbao and then south to Vitoria, the home of the Basque parliament. With 175,000 participants, according to Gure Esku Dago, the group almost doubled the 100,000 it said it would need to link the chain.   \"The need to decide here in the Basque Country is what has brought together more than 175,000 people today. We are not afraid of freedom. The future is in our hands. Gure Esku Dago! #BasquesDecide,\" Gure Esku Dago wrote in a Facebook post.   The chain wasn\\'t strictly about the right to vote for independence. It was also about the right of governance, and importantly, the right of Basques to control their pensions. Organizers drafted a document including 2019 reasons defending their right to decide the independence of the Basque Country. The document was handed to the Basque Parliament in Vitoria. The Spanish constitution, which was ratified in 1978 after the regime of dictator Francisco Franco, states that Spain is both \"common and indivisible\" and maintains that any independence ballot is illegal.  The harsh legal crackdown last year in Catalonia underlined the broad authority Madrid has to stamp out any full-fledged independence movement in order to keep Spain intact. The Basque Country is already one of the most autonomous regions in Spain, having its own police force, education system, language and fiscal agreements, according to Reuters. According to the Euskobarometer, a survey conducted by the University of the Basque Country that measures different levels of sentiment, 23% of Basques felt like they were more Basque than Spanish, and 35% felt they were entirely Basque.  However, only 23% of Basques would vote for independence while 43% would vote against it, according to a separate study carried out by the Bilbao-based University of Deusto. Nonetheless, many Basques -- almost 40% -- would like to have even more autonomy and believe they should have the right to vote for independence, according to the study.  The human chain comes a few months after ETA -- the Basque separatist group that killed around 850 people in its half-century campaign for independence -- formally disbanded in April. The group sent a letter to various governmental institutions and media agencies in which it apologized to the families of the victims and accepted \"direct responsibility\" for its crimes.  Pedro Sánchez, who recently became Spain\\'s new Prime Minister after replacing Mariano Rajoy after a no-confidence vote, in the past has called for more autonomy for the Basque Country. Rajoy was criticized for his harsh response to the independence vote in Catalonia, which included the use of Spanish national police to suppress voting and the dissolution of the Catalan parliament.  The Basque Nationalist Party initially supported Rajoy, but then ultimately voted for the no confidence motion, which ousted Rajoy from office, making way for Sánchez to become prime minister.

For the first time in Spain\\'s history, 11 women have taken up key posts in the 17-strong cabinet alongside new Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.  The 46-year-old former economics professor, who leads the Spanish Socialist Workers\\' Party, assumed leadership on Saturday, a day after toppling scandal-hit Mariano Rajoy in a no-confidence vote. Just five women served in the last Cabinet under Rajoy.  \"This new government is unequivocally committed to equality. You have heard me say it many times: Spain changed on March 8. There was a before and an after in our country with the feminist mobilizations and the new government is a faithful reflection of that movement,\" Sanchez said Wednesday. On March 8, millions of Spanish women took part in a 24-hour strike aimed at sexual discrimination and gender inequality. Sanchez looked beyond his party in selecting his new ministers including Dolores Delgado -- a state attorney who specialized in the prosecution of jihadist attacks -- as justice minister, Nadia Calviño -- who until recently had been a top EU budget official -- as the economy minister and climate change treaty negotiator Teresa Ribera as environment minister.  Other prominent appointees included Carmen Calvo, who became deputy prime minister and equality minister; former Andalusia councilor María Jesús Montero as budget minister and Meritxell Batet has been tasked with handling the Catalan independence issue as territory administration minister. The newly installed leader said he wanted his new government to be a \"reflection\" of \"the society it aspires to serve.\"  \"A new government for a society like Spain that is parity, half of the citizens are women, intergenerational, open to the world but also anchored in the European Union,\" he continued. Sánchez faces significant challenges after assuming office. He is running a minority government -- since his own party holds only 84 seats in the 350-seat chamber.  With a splintered parliament made up of parties with differing agendas, pushing through major policy shifts will be difficult.  Spain was split last year by the Catalan independence crisis, which remains unresolved, and many Spaniards continue to feel the effects of the global economic crisis. Sánchez also picked astronaut Pedro Duque to serve as the new science minister and Maxim Huerta, a journalist and writer, became the culture and sports minister.

Duque\\'s first space mission was in 1998, aboard the US Space Shuttle Discovery. Five years later, he traveled on a Russian Soyuz spaceship to the International Space Station, where he stayed for 10 days.   The 55-year-old commented on his appointment on Twitter, saying he wished his mother were still alive to see it. Beneath, he posted a drawing from 1982 by late humorist Forges, in which a mother reminds a son as he leaves for work that \"important jobs are the devil\\'s playground.\"   News of Duque\\'s new role prompted a swift response on social media. One Twitter user posted a clip from \"The Simpsons\" in which a UFO crashes into a capitol building, captioned \"Pedro Duque arrives late to a session.\"  Another joked that the rival Ciudadanos party -- whose color is orange -- was working at full pace to install Bruce Willis to counteract Duque.  Women make up six of the 10 Cabinet members so far named by Sánchez, who leads the Spanish Socialist Workers\\' Party.

This week the third- and fourth-largest economies in the eurozone -- Italy and Spain -- experienced political earthquakes. Italy will now have a government of insurgents with little faith in the \"European project.\" Spain will have an odd coalition united only in ousting the unpopular conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Spanish voters likely face their third election in three years. Back in 2012, Europe had its \"PIGS\" problem (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain): toxic banks, overwhelming debt and chronic budget deficits. Now it has the \"PHIGS\" of 2018: Poland, Hungary, Italy, Greece and Spain.  Today the challenges are more complex and diverse -- but they have common roots in a growing popular disenchantment with the political mainstream. And the cast of characters is different. A rude awakening  Italy is the most immediate threat to the European Union. In elections on March 4, Italians mutinied and handed victory to two parties that railed against the establishment both in Rome and in Brussels -- the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League.  They drew support from very different constituencies. The M5S is unashamedly populist, promising poorer Italians a better deal. The League\\'s supporters are better off, but equally hostile to immigration and the power of the EU.   Earlier this week, President Sergio Mattarella nixed their nomination of a prominent euroskeptic as Finance Minister. All hell broke loose, and there were mutterings about impeaching Mattarella. But by the end of the week, the M5S and the League had their way as the President accepted a revised cabinet lineup.   Europe is about to get a rude awakening. But Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, isn\\'t rolling over -- saying that Italy needs \"more work, less corruption, seriousness.\"  The financial markets are relieved Italy has a government after nearly 90 days without, but apprehensive about what comes next. The recipes advanced by M5S and the League combine higher public spending and tax cuts -- a high-risk strategy in a country sitting on a debt pile of 2.1 trillion euros and an inflexible labor market. By contrast, Spain has made huge progress since being on life support six years ago, when its banks were sinking and ratings agencies valued its debt at a notch above junk, on a par with Azerbaijan. Its economy is growing at a healthy tick; unemployment is down (though still high); its credit rating is restored. And Spaniards are enthusiastically pro-Europe.  So why worry? Because politics in Spain -- long dominated by the conservative Popular Party (PP) and the Socialists -- has splintered. Not only is there separatism in Catalonia but two parties, Podemos and Ciudadanos, have emerged to challenge the old duopoly. Podemos has the same sort of populist roots as M5S (though its prescriptions are very different); Ciudadanos rails against endemic corruption. Spain had two elections in 2016. Both delivered stalemate; eventually Mariano Rajoy cobbled together a minority government. But corruption convictions against senior PP members last week led to a no-confidence motion in Parliament. Now Spain has a Socialist Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, whose party holds just 84 of the 350 parliamentary seats.  The other PHIGS What of the other PHIGS? Greece has known nothing other than crisis for nearly a decade. In 2012, an ignominious exit from the eurozone looked almost inevitable.  Now Greece runs a budget surplus, but its cumulative debt is 180% of its gross domestic product (Italy\\'s is 133%.) On August 20, it exits the intensive care administered by the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, but Europe has to decide what sort of debt relief it will offer on the $280 billion Athens still owes.  Germany and others are not in charitable mood, and there\\'s no guarantee of an agreement that will allow Greece to sustain its debt load when EU finance ministers hold a make-or-break meeting later this month.  Then there are Poland and Hungary. They are financially in good shape but at war with Brussels on everything from immigration and the independence of the judiciary to freedom of the press and \"democratic values.\"  They have right-wing populist governments that might be charitably described as \"semi-detached\" from the EU. Both rejected EU plans for migrant quotas to share the burden of the influx arriving across the Mediterranean, prompting the European Commission to bring legal action.   Viktor Orban, who dominates Hungarian politics as Prime Minister (he won his third term in April) and leader of the governing Fidesz party, promotes what he calls an \"illiberal\" alternative to European consensus. Poland, meanwhile, has sided with the Trump administration against its European partners on subjects as varied as Iran sanctions and Russian gas pipelines to Europe. Warsaw\\'s measures to restrict the independence of the judiciary have brought censure from Brussels. To try to rein in these wayward members, European officials are floating the prospect of cuts in the generous financial support given to the former Communist states that joined the EU in the 1990s. The EU budget will take a hit when the UK leaves; Poland (which gets about one-tenth of the EU budget) and Hungary may pay the price. And finally of course, on the EU\\'s menu of unsolved issues, the terms for Brexit are far from concluded, despite more than a year of negotiations and the looming deadline of March 2019.   Once Britain leaves, Germany and France will once again be the motors of Europe, as they were when the original Common Market was formed. There were hopes that a Macron-Merkel axis would lead the European Union to the sunlit uplands of a new era, but the French President\\'s ambitions to deepen integration are not matched by the German Chancellor\\'s caution. Merkel has been chastened by the eruption of German populism in the shape of the Alternative for Germany, the far-right anti-immigrant party that is now the official opposition in the German parliament. As if Macron and Merkel don\\'t have enough on their hands, the EU also has to deal with the headache of an incipient trade war with the US. In 1954 one of Merkel\\'s predecessors, Konrad Adenauer, set out lofty goals. \"The unity of Europe was the dream of a few. It became the hope of many. Today it has become a necessity for all of us,\" he said. In its many iterations since, the European project has survived crisis after crisis. Odds are it will stumble through these multiple challenges. But if the horizon looked dark in 2012, it\\'s positively thunderous now.', 'thumbnail': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180601172911-spain-pedro-sanchez-parliament-story-body.jpg', 'language': 'en', 'tags': [{'id': '8d12fa13-0159-4c46-ad62-5fb4958343b3'}, {'id': 'aa51fd2f-118b-4cba-bcc7-c4395f56bbac'}, {'id': '80472d18-063b-58fb-85a5-f716fdb8b777'}, {'id': '86877965-735a-482b-80ba-df17d2a73478'}, {'id': '5f604c29-efcb-422c-bae9-da8c3c0fefcf'}, {'id': '3101ac61-5e6c-5472-8de3-c49654a2db03'}, {'id': 'fe34558e-3a94-42e4-89d5-510382231977'}, {'id': '6b05b474-af4a-4829-89b5-e19952888c64'}, {'id': '8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e'}, {'id': '49b3767f-e5b3-40be-aee2-f6c1d7c9fe7c'}, {'id': 'a82dffe9-937e-42c0-9c66-db3f2f4fcca8'}, {'id': '15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158'}, {'id': 'b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c'}, {'id': '38d781fa-4633-4525-a5b8-579a43315f74'}, {'id': '569432e3-cee0-4fdd-9009-e2be2a42ab54'}, {'id': 'cd86b20b-6403-4e78-b813-1bb72ae1e550'}, {'id': 'fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9'}, {'id': '84651cf3-02b9-4e37-8627-dc8b96235ba7'}, {'id': '2f999c15-7293-52a7-a0ee-e8b658c08137'}, {'id': 'edbe1e5e-ef24-4ab9-bfd1-b29c17df9f6f'}]}, {'_id': 'h_6c8a5dcb26cd5b0b232d0f1b57f97763', 'type': 'article', 'sourceId': 'article_E791B53F-DDF0-D643-830B-BFB607228A60', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/02/europe/spain-swears-in-prime-minister-sanchez-intl/index.html', 'path': '/2018/06/02/europe/spain-swears-in-prime-minister-sanchez-intl', 'source': 'cnn', 'location': 'Madrid', 'byLine': 'By Laura Smith-Spark and Laura Perez Maestro, CNN', 'contributors': ['Laura Smith-Spark', 'Laura Perez Maestro'], 'firstPublishDate': '2018-06-02T09:43:59Z', 'lastModifiedDate': '2018-06-02T14:26:30Z', 'headline': \"Pedro Sánchez sworn in as Spain's Prime Minister after ousting Mariano Rajoy\", 'section': 'europe', 'mappedSection': 'WORLD', 'body': 'Pedro Sánchez was sworn in Saturday as Spain\\'s Prime Minister, a day after ousting scandal-hit political rival Mariano Rajoy in a no-confidence vote. Sánchez, who leads the Spanish Socialist Workers\\' Party, took the oath of office before King Felipe VI at the Zarzuela Palace near Madrid. He was the first Spanish Prime Minister to be sworn in without a Bible or crucifix, according to his party. \"I promise by my conscience and honor to faithfully fulfill the obligations of the office of President of the Government with loyalty to the King, and to keep and enforce the Constitution as the fundamental norm of the State,\" Sánchez said. Rajoy was present at the ceremony, shook Sánchez\\'s hand and wished him good luck. The 46-year-old politician faces significant challenges as he assumes office. Spain was riven last year by the Catalan independence crisis, which remains unresolved, and many Spaniards continue to feel the effects of the global economic crisis. Sánchez -- a pro-European economics professor who was a keen basketball player in his youth -- previously said he would call for snap elections should he become Prime Minister. Sánchez will work on his Cabinet this weekend, and it will be announced at some point next week, his party said. His Socialists secured support for the no-confidence motion from a number of other parties in parliament, including the anti-austerity Podemos, Catalan pro-independence parties and the Basque Nationalist Party.  Since his own party holds only 84 seats in the 350-seat chamber, Sánchez will need to keep those parties, with their differing agendas, on his side in order to pass any legislation.  Europe is on the verge of a big new crisis Catalan leader: \\'Let\\'s talk\\' Catalonia\\'s separatist President Quim Torra called Saturday for dialogue with Sánchez as members of the Catalan regional executive were sworn in in Barcelona, ending seven months of direct rule by Madrid. \"President Pedro Sánchez: Let\\'s talk and let\\'s meet,\" Torra said. \"Let\\'s take risks, from your side and our side. Let\\'s sit at the same table and negotiate from government to government. This situation we are experiencing can\\'t go on any longer.\" Catalonia\\'s independence drive plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in decades. Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia after the regional parliament unilaterally declared independence in October, thereby stripping the autonomous region of many of its administrative powers.  Some of the Cabinet members wore yellow at their swearing-in ceremony to recall Catalan separatists who remain in prison or in self-imposed exile over their role in the independence bid. Among those is Carles Puigdemont, the former president of Catalonia, who is currently in Germany. \\'Spain starts a new page\\' Posting Friday on Twitter, Sánchez promised a fresh start for the country. \"Spain starts a new page. A period to recover the dignity of its institutions. From responsibility, dialogue and consensus, it is time to work for equality, to build a country that does not leave anyone behind,\" he said. Rajoy had been in power since 2011 as the head of the Popular Party. On Friday, he became the first leader in Spain\\'s modern democracy to lose a no-confidence vote in parliament. The Socialists tweeted that it was a \"great day for democracy\" and that the party would \"work responsibly to give back our country the dignity it deserves.\" Rajoy\\'s party has been plagued with corruption allegations for years. Rajoy has faced the humiliation of testifying in cases against its members, though he has not been among the accused.

The demise of Rajoy -- one of Europe\\'s longest-serving political leaders -- paves the way for Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the main opposition Socialist party, to become Prime Minister.  Friday\\'s vote in Madrid was the culmination of years of corruption allegations against Rajoy\\'s Popular Party (PP). The scandal came to a head last week when a court convicted his former aides of running slush funds to help finance PP election campaigns, prompting Sánchez to file the confidence motion. The fall of Rajoy\\'s government comes at a time of wider political turmoil in Europe. Two populist parties in Italy have just reached an agreement to form a coalition government after months of wrangling, Brexit dominates UK politics and the European Union must now contend with a looming trade war with the US. Spain\\'s political tumult is born of a long-running corruption scandal coupled with internal division. Although still feeling the effects of the global economic crisis, Spain\\'s economy is performing better than that of Italy, and anti-European sentiment played no part in its change of government.   Nonetheless, Sánchez, leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers\\' Party (PSOE), faces significant challenges as he assumes office. Spain was riven last year by the Catalan independence crisis, which remains unresolved. Rajoy\\'s fate was sealed on Thursday after the Socialists secured support for the no-confidence motion from a number of smaller parties in Parliament, including the Basque Nationalist Party.  In total, 180 of the chamber\\'s 350 lawmakers voted in support of the motion, a clear majority. There were 169 votes against and one abstention. It was the first time in Spain\\'s post-1977 democracy that a Spanish Prime Minister has fallen in this way. Ana Pastor, President of the lower house of the Spanish Parliament, announced that Sánchez has \"the trust of the Parliament\" and so becomes the new Prime Minister of Spain. In line with the constitution, she was to inform Spain\\'s King Felipe II on Friday afternoon. Sánchez received a standing ovation, with parliamentarians shouting: \"Yes, it can be done.\"  Rajoy shook hands with Sánchez, his 46-year-old successor, to congratulate him. Speaking shortly before the vote, Rajoy said he had been proud to serve his country. \"It has been an honor to leave a better Spain than I found,\" he said. \"I wish my substitute could say the same when his day comes, for the good of Spain.\" Sánchez -- a pro-European economics professor who was a keen basketball player in his youth -- previously said that he would call for snap elections should he become Prime Minister. He is expected to take office and nominate his Cabinet next week. Posting on Twitter, Sánchez promised a fresh start for the country. \"Spain starts a new page. A period to recover the dignity of its institutions. From responsibility, dialogue and consensus, it is time to work for equality, to build a country that does not leave anyone behind,\" he said. Separatist parties Sánchez became PSOE leader in 2014, when the photogenic then-42-year-old was thought of as the new young and \"handsome\" face of politics. But in 2016 his party performed poorly in elections and was unable to assemble a coalition government to keep Rajoy out of power. That didn\\'t sit well with some people in his party and in October of that year he resigned under pressure.  He then presented himself as a candidate for the primaries and won comfortably in 2017, proof that he remained popular with socialists in Spain. However, critics have accused him of wanting to become Prime Minister whatever the price.  Sánchez needed the support of fringe and pro-independence parties, as well as the anti-austerity Podemos party, to push the confidence motion through Parliament. And, since his own party holds only 84 seats, Sánchez will need to keep those parties, with their differing agendas, on his side in order to pass any legislation.  He has previously said he would stick to the budget recently passed by Rajoy\\'s government and continue to enact socioeconomic reforms. Nathan Jones, a Spanish politics expert at Britain\\'s Nottingham Trent University, said the ousting of Rajoy\\'s government represented another step into the unknown for Spain. \"Thus far, few of the parties who backed the vote of no confidence in Rajoy have indicated that they will support Sánchez\\'s government, increasing the probability of a snap general election, the third since 2015, having to be called,\" he said.  \"Support for Sánchez from parties other than Podemos may yet still emerge; however, significant divisions remain between many of the political parties, thus establishing a stable government is far from certain.\" Rajoy: \\'A better Spain\\' Rajoy, who came to office in 2011, had effectively conceded defeat ahead of the vote, congratulating Sánchez on his expected win in a brief address to Parliament. \"In light of what we all know, I presume that the vote of no confidence will go ahead, and Pedro Sánchez will become the Prime Minister and I want to be the first to congratulate him,\" Rajoy said, visibly moved as he gave what was to be his last address as Spain\\'s leader. \"I will accept the result of the vote as the democrat I am, but I cannot agree with what has been done.\"  Rajoy\\'s party has been plagued with corruption allegations for years. Rajoy himself has faced the humiliation of testifying in cases against PP members, though he has not been among the accused. The confidence motion was filed by Sánchez after a court convicted Rajoy\\'s former aides of running slush funds to help finance Popular Party election campaigns. The court also questioned the credibility of Rajoy\\'s testimony during the proceedings. It was the first time in Spain that a party had been convicted and fined on corruption-related charges. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, tweeted his congratulations to Sánchez. \"I trust that the Spanish government will continue contributing in a constructive way for a Europe that is stronger, more united and fairer,\" he said, adding that Spain \"plays a very important role\" in the European project.  European Council President Donald Tusk also offered his congratulations, saying Sánchez\\'s appointment came at a \"challenging time\" for the continent. \"European unity is now more needed than ever,\" he said in a statement.  The Party of European Socialists (PES), made up of parties from across the European Union, welcomed Sánchez\\'s election, saying his government would form a \"credible alternative to a conservative government hounded by corruption.\" PES President Sergei Stanishev described Sánchez as \"a progressive and honest pro-European\" who would \"shift away from the austerity policies of the past years in his country.\"', 'thumbnail': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180601100729-01-mariano-rajoy-0601-story-body.jpg', 'language': 'en', 'tags': [{'id': 'fd529c2d-a4f7-4f7e-b39a-850e8a28c03f'}, {'id': 'fbe98f94-1270-4f73-beb1-6afa11d63269'}, {'id': '3f72e7a5-3e51-4a2f-a567-eda6cb4d7734'}, {'id': '5449b934-cb55-45e6-90af-c345f562a7a4'}, {'id': 'bd0bf3d7-f33b-4c20-812f-f9ad2b527846'}, {'id': '8d7177ef-0a7e-44b5-9a58-6c98c0968023'}, {'id': '18f3e242-2811-4e08-9424-145261521f2c'}, {'id': '86f1d6f8-6a48-4e2c-8c1c-d3a9cbc794c2'}, {'id': '7691bc4e-7b66-4400-9ce9-789f697ada59'}, {'id': '3b05b667-bbc2-4ea2-9b4b-bfec81011a99'}, {'id': '29e2ee2a-6115-4a69-ae08-7518c546b70c'}, {'id': 'ccc4a354-efd2-44fd-853d-920b0a747198'}, {'id': '6b05b474-af4a-4829-89b5-e19952888c64'}, {'id': '1284a3f6-c163-4839-a42a-3663595a0caf'}, {'id': '2a3ec567-9751-4034-a503-5ac4e27ce591'}, {'id': '8041cc9b-1edc-4395-88e0-2d8c1e4a6e0e'}, {'id': 'c0fa8aaa-8c65-485d-808f-8165e66d931d'}, {'id': '367de685-425c-4d43-9330-c12428eb77e6'}, {'id': 'b852b5d8-31c6-49e9-8ff1-986a55356fa1'}, {'id': '85186acd-6f35-432b-9fd7-5586c122151d'}, {'id': '9bcd9f98-0314-43c5-b4a6-4c06a3180d4d'}, {'id': '15b65e37-2543-43f2-a460-1e2c44f2f158'}, {'id': '8d12fa13-0159-4c46-ad62-5fb4958343b3'}, {'id': 'b7d87976-22be-4e92-82f2-a977c74dd73c'}, {'id': '569432e3-cee0-4fdd-9009-e2be2a42ab54'}, {'id': 'fac832e0-e093-5f0b-b5e0-4abb7b4e4fa9'}, {'id': '7868d30d-351e-49d6-b43c-cada30480487'}, {'id': '5da77f4f-b1c0-4f34-85db-e9e8ec049abe'}, {'id': 'c753c773-f66f-52cb-ba12-1bdf4573b592'}, {'id': '58da1feb-6773-40a4-bb2c-2267f06c5689'}, {'id': '9c5826c0-329c-54ce-b065-3826ae02b3ab'}, {'id': '8c227858-cddf-41b4-9eee-7acdde84ad8c'}, {'id': '371d0edb-606f-5060-9394-aa93235b9684'}, {'id': 'd73e719e-040c-4840-a2a6-c04b8310dfcb'}, {'id': 'edbe1e5e-ef24-4ab9-bfd1-b29c17df9f6f'}]}]\n"

Además, ha bajado al fango de la actualidad política para advertir a Ciudadanos de que la única opción de gobierno de cambio en Andalucía es que el PP presida la Junta y la formación naranja, el Parlamento. Si no, habrá que repetir las elecciones.\\n\\nA su juicio, no hay consenso suficiente para \"abrir un proceso de reforma agravada\", ya que se pondría sobre la mesa la ruptura de España y la ruptura de la Monarquía. Por eso Casado ha alertado de que usará su \"minoría de bloqueo\" en el Congreso y su mayoría absoluta en el Senado para tumbar cualquier propuesta de reforma que se salga de los meros retoques y que no se circunscriba \"a las necesidades y urgencias de la nación española\".\\n\\nDespués, en conversación informal con los periodistas, el presidente del PP ha comentado la actualidad política, con el foco principal en las posibilidades de pactar un gobierno \"de cambio\" en Andalucía. A su juicio, no cabe otra opción que una investidura de Juanma Moreno como presidente de la Junta, mediante un pacto con Ciudadanos y con los votos de Vox.\\n\\nEl PP quiere cerrar un acuerdo con Ciudadanos para sumar 47 escaños y llegar así a la sesión de investidura, donde Vox debería prestarle el apoyo de sus 12 diputados. Ese acuerdo, que está por definir, podría ser \"de investidura, de legislatura o de Gobierno\", ha asegurado Casado. Será Ciudadanos el que \"elija\", pero lo cierto es que los populares están dispuestos a ofrecer a los naranjas una Vicepresidencia de la Junta y la Presidencia del Parlamento, además de varias consejerías (aproximadamente, la mitad).\\n\\nCasado ha revelado que el acuerdo de la Mesa del Parlamento de Andalucía \"vinculará la investidura\". Es decir, el 27 de diciembre, cuando se sepa quién preside la Cámara autonómica, ya sabremos quién será, también, el presidente de la Junta. Por ejemplo, si Cs se hace con la Presidencia del Parlamento, Juanma Moreno llevará las riendas del gobierno regional.\\n\\nEn todo caso, para Pablo Casado sólo hay dos posibilidades: o una investidura de Juanma Moreno \"o elecciones\". Y en este escenario tanto populares como naranjas tienen claro que el PSOE-A de Susana Díaz recuperaría apoyos y que el partido o partidos al que señalasen como culpable los electores de centroderecha sufriría un descalabro. En favor de Vox.\\n\\nEn el PP creen que la posibilidad de acuerdo \"va bien\", y que la interlocución entre el secretario general del PP, Teodoro García Egea, y el de Cs, José Manuel Villegas, \"es buena\". Casado quiere esperar a que el PSOE descarte definitivamente pactar con Ciudadanos.\\n\\nA ese pacto se debería sumar Vox, al que Casado no le concederá ni la devolución de competencias al Estado -sólo se recentralizarían, por la vía legislativa- ni el cierre de Canal Sur, por la sencilla razón de que no puede llevarse a cabo sin reformar el Estatuto de autonomía. Y PP, Cs y Vox no suman los votos suficientes para hacerlo, ya que son necesarias dos terceras partes del Parlamento. Lo que quiere el PP es adelgazar al máximo la televisión pública y laminar a productoras afines al PSOE.\\n\\nCasado ha asegurado que la formación de Santiago Abascal no es xenófoba. \"Vox es más Trump que Le Pen\", ha ejemplificado. \"Es un partido a la espera de definir, y sus propuestas no son muy distintas a las de toros partidos. Por ejemplo, proponen quitar las autonomías y Ciudadanos quería quitar el Senado\", ha dicho.\\n\\nDonde sí ve Casado margen de acuerdo con Vox es en la reforma de la ley de violencia de género, si se circunscribe a las denuncias falsas, y en inmigración, siempre dentro del marco legal actual.\\n\\nLa estrategia de Casado para la refundación del centroderecha no implica a Vox. El presidente del PP ha invitado hoy a Cs a \"echarse al centro\" para \"optimizar espacios\". ¿Qué significa esto? Que si la formación de Albert Rivera lucha por el nicho de centro izquierda que está abandonando al PSOE y el PP se consolida en su posición actual \"sin complejos\" y frena a Vox, el constitucionalismo se afianzaría con rapidez: \"Podríamos gobernar los dos con mayoría absoluta en un año, o en seis meses\", ha subrayado el líder popular.\\n\\nEl presidente de la Xunta de Galicia, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, se ha desmarcado de Casado con un matiz. Para él, el PP no se ha sacudido los complejos ni ha modificado su rumbo político. \"A mí nadie me ha dicho que hayamos cambiado el discurso. No creo que el PP tenga que hacerlo\", ha aseverado.\\n\\nLa nueva vida de Rajoy El ex presidente del Gobierno, Mariano Rajoy / ANTONIO HEREDIA Uno de los políticos que más expectación han suscitado en el Congreso ha sido Mariano Rajoy. El ex presidente del Gobierno no ha querido hacer declaraciones en los tradicionales corrillos del 6 de diciembre, más allá de comentar su situación personal. Seis meses después de la moción de censura que lo desalojó de La Moncloa, Rajoy sólo ha querido comentar que se ha acostumbrado muy bien a su nueva vida, que sigue la política con menos intensidad que antes y que la vuelta al Registro no le ha sido difícil. El resto de cuestiones \"no procede hoy\", ha dicho.\\n\\n\\n\\nEn un vídeo publicado en redes por el PP, Rajoy sí ha opinado sobre la vigencia de la Constitución y de los valores de la Transición en pleno desafío independentista catalán: \"Apostar por la convivencia siempre es rentable. Apostar por la división y el enfrentamiento no conduce a nada positivo\".\\n\\nConforme a los criterios de Saber más'}]\n"
